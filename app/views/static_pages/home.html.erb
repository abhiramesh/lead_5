		Attorney Advertisement â€“ The information that you provide on this website is sent to a participating attorney or advocate solely on the basis of the zip code that you provide and not by any other means of evaluation.  These participating attorneys and advocates pay a fee to be part of this website and receive inquiries solely based upon the geographic regions that they choose to service.  The information that you provide on this website is used by the attorney or advocate to make a preliminary evaluation of your claim.  Not until an attorney or advocate has spoken to you on the telephone can a complete evaluation be made as to your potential eligibility for disability benefits. The ultimate determination as to the eligibility of disability benefits will be made by the Social Security Administration. NJ residents only: please <a href="/nj">click here</a> to view a list of attorneys who are responsible for advertisement to prospective clients in the state of New Jersey.<br>FEES: YOU WILL NOT BE CHARGED A FEE unless your attorney or advocate wins your case. If a case is won in your favor, the fee is not paid out of your pocket, but instead is paid directly to the attorney/advocate directly from the Social Security Administration.  The fees are set by the Social Security Administration and your representative is not allowed to charge more than $6,000 or 25% of all past due benefits whichever is less through the initial hearing.  If you are not successful at the initial hearing and your attorney/advocate must appeal your case, they can charge additional fees which will be stated in your fee agreement with that attorney/advocate.  Each attorney or advocate will have you sign a fee agreement that will allow them to be paid a fee directly by the Social Security Administration.
